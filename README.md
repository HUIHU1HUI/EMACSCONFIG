# EMACSCONFIG
My full emacs configuration 

- IDE-like features for C++
- Autocompletion/flycheck for Rust and Js
- Text formatting (aggressive indents, colors etc..)
- Easy window management using numbers  (with M-o + window number)

A work in progress to eventually replace all of different text editors and IDEs I have.
